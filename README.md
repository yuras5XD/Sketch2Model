# Sketch2Model
Introduction: 
This repository contains the implementation of a GNN-based approach to the Sketch2Model problem. The goal of this project is to generate 3D models from 2D hand-drawn sketches.

Requirements: 
Python 3.12.X
PyTorch
PyTorch Geometric
Matplotlib
NumPy
stl-numpy
OS
E3NN
Tkinter
CUDA (Optional, for GPU acceleration)

Dataset: 
The dataset used for training and evaluation is taken from ABC_Dataset.
Homepage: https://deep-geometry.github.io/abc-dataset/

Please ensure that you update the dataset and output directory paths in all relevant files before running the program.
